This is a React-based app utilizing the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) to generate a selection of Brewdog's DIY Dog homebrew recipes. Users have the option to display a random recipe that may not be part of the 25 shown.

Due to time constraints, the user can only access the beer recipe description at the moment. Recipe to follow shortly. As well, the randomize function currently only delivers one random beer description. User must refresh the page to generate another random beer.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
