This is a React-based app utilizing the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) to generate a selection of Brewdog's DIY Dog homebrew recipes. Users have the option to display a random recipe that may not be part of the 25 shown.

Due to time constraints, the user can only access the recipe description at the moment. Recipe to follow shortly.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
